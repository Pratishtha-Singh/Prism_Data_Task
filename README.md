# Prism_Data_Task

In this Project, I have used Pandas and IPython.display libraries. You can use the below code to install them in your local machine.

pip install Pandas  
pip install IPython.display


Make sure to keep the dataset files and ipynb file in the same folder.

The code asks for user input once you run it. Below is the input I used to test the program. Give the inputs as comma separated values.

instrument_codes = IXN23AKB31500,IXN22QKB63500  
start_time = 00:00:08:000  
end_time = 14:30:00:170  
requested_fields = Bid market,Bid size,RT of last update in Seconds (EST) (MCR),Add (3) / Modify (2) / Delete (1) Flag  

Image file of output (output.png) can be found in the main directory.
